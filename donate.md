# Donation Information
Although Image Sourcerer is mostly free to run, there are components of that that could get better with funding. Many sites, namely Pixiv and Reddit, utilize features that don't allow you to download the image normally. Instead of loading proprietary software to block these features, the current solution is to run a server that allows you to bypass them. You may notice downloads take longer on these sites.

However, I'm using the server's free version, so the speeds will be slow and everybody gets a maximum of 550 server hours monthly. If images don't download from certain sites, or are taking a very long time, this is most likely the problem.

If you would like to see the speeds improve, please consider donating! The money will primarily go towards getting better servers with higher speeds and more uptime. If you like Image Sourcerer and want to see it stay live, please donate what you think is fair [here](https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/JakeGuy11)!
