*Image Sourcerer* is a browser extension supported on Chrome and Chrome extension based browsers that is designed to download, sort and track images from supported sites. Once complete, this application will help users download images from content-rich sites, letting them control how it is organized and keeping track of the original creators for future reference.

# IMPORTANT NOTICE - README!!!

This extension has remained unmaintained for over a year, but I'm finally beginning to re-update it! Please be patient as, yet again, I work through all site scripts and basically re-make them to work with the newer versions of the websites.

~~We are currently looking for beta testers! Find out more [here](https://github.com/JakeGuy11/image-sourcerer/blob/main/beta-testing.md)!~~

# Installation
1. Download and extract the [latest release](https://github.com/JakeGuy11/image-sourcerer/releases) OR download the lasted commit:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/JakeGuy11/image-sourcerer.git
# or
git clone git@github.com:JakeGuy11/image-sourcerer.git
```
2. Navigate to `chrome://extensions` in your browser. Other brosers that support chrome extensions will usually redirect you to their specific extension pages.
3. You will have to enable developer mode by toggling the switch usually in the upper right corner. Click "Load Unpacked", navigate to where you saved the repository and select open.
5. Open any supported site. The extension should now be functional.
