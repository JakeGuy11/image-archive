*Image Sourcerer* is a browser extension supported on Chrome and Chrome extension based browsers that is designed to download, sort and track images from supported sites. Once complete, this application will help users download images from content-rich sites, letting them control how it is organized and keeping track of the original creators for future reference.

We are currently looking for beta testers! Find out more [here](https://github.com/JakeGuy11/image-sourcerer/blob/main/beta-testing.md)!

# Installation
### To install on Chome (and other browsers that use the chrome store):
1. Download and extract the [latest release](https://github.com/JakeGuy11/image-sourcerer/releases) OR download the lasted commit:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/JakeGuy11/image-sourcerer.git
# or
git clone git@github.com:JakeGuy11/image-sourcerer.git
```
2. Navigate to `chrome://extensions` in your browser. Other brosers that support chrome extensions will usually redirect you to their specific extension pages.
3. Click "Load Unpacked", navigate to where you saved the repository and select open.
5. Open any supported site. The extension should now be functional.
6. Steps 2 through 5 must be repeated every time the browser is restarted until an official release is uploaded.
